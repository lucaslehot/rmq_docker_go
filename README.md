## Todo 
***before*** June 22th :
- send an e-mail to the teacher with a link towards this repo.
- make the teacher a contributor (if the repo isn't public).
> note: we shall all be in copy of the e-mail.

The repo should include :
* the code corresponding to the "local" version
* with a complete Readme, including 
    * the 2 schemas (any format is fine)
    * how to run the app
    * how to test it (e.g.: does it launch a localhost:8080 with an interface and an image ?)
